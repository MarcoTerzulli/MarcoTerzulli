# Hi, I'm Marco! 👋🏻👩🏻‍💻

I'm a **Doctor in Computer Science**, based in Italy 🇮🇹. Currently enrolled in the Master's Degree Course in Computer Science at [**University of Modena and Reggio Emilia**](https://www.unimore.it/).

I'm a versatile programmer in various programming languages, such as **C**, **C++**, **Java** and **Python**.
I prefer **Back-End Web Developement** and the **Big Data Administration**; I'm able to work with the most popular DBMS such as **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**.

Computer Science and tech are my biggest passions: I'm always updated about the latest news and trends of the moment. I also find PC assembly and overclocking techniques very intersting.
